					</div>

					<div class="para-before">

						<p>(Hong Kong City) –A super yacht named the ‘The Golden Bull’ that has been spotted in the Hong Kong Marina has been catching the eyes of many people with its extravagant parties, champagne showers on deck, and sunbathing supermodels. It has also been sited anchoring at some of the most luxurious destinations like Abu Dhabi, Fiji, Singapore and Sydney. The lavish <a href="#">yacht is rumored</a> to have cost $30 million and has aroused many growing speculations about the owner’s identity.</p>

						<p>Although the yacht is very eye catching with all the parties and people on it, the real interest was drawn towards the yacht’s owner, a young man in his 20’s who apparently runs his own business while living on the yacht. When taking a look at the young owner, you would be surprised how such a young man managed to amass such large amounts of money.</p>

						<div class="col-sm-5 col-xs-12 para-block">
							<span>"</span>
							<p>It’s interesting. South African's just have a better approach to binary options than the rest of the world. They are a courageous people.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="after-para-block"><span>A South African knows how to make decisions quickly, and this is exactly how success in trading is achieved. It helps that Binary Options are easy, the outcome of any given investment is known in minutes not months. It’s immediate and it really helps when you are setting lofty goals.</span> <a href="#">You simply keep going until you succeed. These days it’s not strange</a> to hear that people lacking a university degree are making millions and then contacting me to know what to do with it.”“This is not a problem anymore since Broker are now providing excellent trading tools which do all the leg work automatically. A new trader only has to register an account and simply ask for the trading tools and some guidance from an account manager to understand the market trends. So why are we not seeing more and more ultra-luxury apartment buildings sprouting up full of Binary Options millionaires? Actually we are, but the numbers are being kept in check by industry regulations that only allow a limited number of people to get the Binary Options platform and actually start trading. </p>

						<p>“I’m not that guy. Give me a good monthly income and more free time and I’m happy. I don’t need the flashy cars, I just want to know my kids won’t want for anything, and get a head start in life that I didn’t have. Binary Options opened my eyes.”</p>

						<p>It’s clear to me that Binary Options is a great way to make money from home, but it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. It’s not easy to find a good broker that provides the trading tools and easy to use software. Governments are now noticing the large sums being made and may plan to restrict who has access to this profitable method. We don’t predict that they will take over Binary Options trading this year, so many will still have the chance to use the Binary goldmine for a while longer. Bradley gave a few tips for the readers who are ready to start making money from home. When signing up with Broker, make sure you request a 100% sign up bonus. This is an offer few know about that will effectively double your money before you’ve even started, and give you better leverage for trading.</p>

						<p><span>UPDATE:</span> <a href="#">July 2016…</a> After numerous requests from our readers, we decided to add a simple and descriptive way to sign up with the broker. Please note only a limited number of people will be accepted to trade with real money on any given day. Please do not email us asking if we can help you get accepted, as this is the broker’s regulations. If you are not accepted, please try again at a later stage.</p>
